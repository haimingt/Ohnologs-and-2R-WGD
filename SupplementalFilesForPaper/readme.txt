Supplemental materials:

Part1: Extracted genes of 17 vertebrates sorted by chromosomal locations. The vertebrate genes are descendants of the duplication events at early vertebrates.

Part2: Synteny evidences summarized from the genes extracted in Part1 including multiplicons and the paralogous gene pairs with different levels of synteny evidences.

Part3: The reconstructed duplications events at early vertebrates and the inferred Ohnologs that are descendants of these duplication events.

S Part 4:  Simulation study results and scripts which randomize the gene orders in vertebrate genomes

Supplemental Figure 1: Real examples of the direct, level 1 and level 2 evidences
Supplemental Figure 2: Overlap of the human ohnolog pairs for 3 methods

The software package for ancestral reconstruction is included in https://github.com/haimingt/genome_history_inference.
